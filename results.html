                    <h3>Why you're seeing this</h3>
                    <p>You indicated that AI initiates or guides workflows that include certain risk characteristics, such as identity verification, regulatory disclosures, or interaction with enterprise systems.</p>
                    <p>While these workflows don't yet exhibit the full combination of traits that create systemic risk, they already operate in a zone where errors, deviations, or incomplete steps can cause problems downstream.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="section">
                    <h3>What kind of risk this represents</h3>
                    <p>Early-stage workflow risk tends to show up as inconsistent completion, manual intervention, edge cases that escalate to humans, or occasional rework.</p>
                    <p>None of these are catastrophic alone, but in regulated or compliance-sensitive environments, small gaps accumulate into audit findings, customer disputes, or operational drag.</p>

                    <h3>What typically works at this stage</h3>
                    <p>The most effective early intervention is usually to introduce lightweight structure at the point of completion.</p>
                    <p>This can take the form of micro-apps, guided execution layers, or step-enforced handoffs that ensure critical actions actually complete correctly without creating heavy process overhead.</p>
                    <p>Risk rarely appears all at once. It accumulates as more steps are automated, more systems are connected, and more decisions become irreversible.</p>
                    <p>Putting structure in place early is how teams stay ahead of that curve.</p>

                    <h3>What kind of risk this represents</h3>
                    <p>In high-consequence workflows, failure is rarely obvious in the moment.</p>
                    <p>Risk emerges when steps are skipped, branches are misrouted, data is partially written, or evidence is incomplete even if the workflow appears to have finished.</p>
                    <p>Because these workflows often touch regulated systems or customer entitlements, issues tend to surface later as audit findings, customer disputes, compliance breaches, or operational incidents.</p>

                    <h3>Why AI changes the equation</h3>
                    <p>AI systems are probabilistic by nature. They are not designed to guarantee exact step order, enforce policy deterministically, or produce immutable evidence by default.</p>
                    <p>As soon as AI is responsible for initiating or progressing high-stakes workflows, the risk profile changes from localized execution errors to systemic exposure.</p>
                    <p>This is not a failure of AI capability. It is a mismatch between probabilistic systems and deterministic requirements.</p>

                    <h3>What this does not mean</h3>

                        <li>AI should be removed from your workflows</li>
                        <li>Your automation strategy is fundamentally flawed</li>

                    <h3>What typically works at this stage</h3>
                    <p>When AI initiates workflows with regulatory or irreversible consequences, teams typically introduce a dedicated completion and compliance layer.</p>
                    <p>This layer separates intelligence from execution. AI can guide and reason, while completion is handled through deterministic, governed steps.</p>
                    <p>The goal is not to slow workflows down, but to ensure they finish correctly, consistently, and with audit-ready evidence.</p>
